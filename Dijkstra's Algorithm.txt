Dijkstra's Algorithm:

path, dist, and found arrays are used to store path information, distances, and visited vertices.
print_step(): Prints the current state of the algorithm.
print_shortest_path(): Prints the shortest path between two vertices.
choose_vertex(): Selects the vertex with the minimum distance from the set of unvisited vertices.
shortest_path_dijkstra(): Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths.

How the Code Works:
Dijkstra's Algorithm Execution:
The shortest_path_dijkstra() function is called with the starting vertex (index 0 in this case).
The algorithm iteratively finds the shortest path to each vertex, updating distances and paths in the dist and path arrays.
choose_vertex() selects the unvisited vertex with the minimum distance.
The print_step() function provides intermediate results for debugging purposes.
